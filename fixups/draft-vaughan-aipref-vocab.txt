     Vocabulary for Expressing Content Preferences for AI Training
                   draft-vaughan-aipref-vocab-latest

Abstract

   This document proposes a vocabulary for expressing content
   preferences for rightsholders who wish to manage the use of their
   content in AI training.  This vocabulary allows publishers to express
   preferences through metadata or content-delivery protocols.  The
   vocabulary can be applied at different levels of granularity and
   incorporates preferences for permissions, usage scope, and data
   retention, providing a foundation for interoperability across various
   Internet protocols.

1.  Introduction

   As AI models become more reliant on large-scale data (driven by
   scaling laws that link model performance to dataset size), content
   publishers seek ways to control how their content is used in training
   these models.  This draft provides a vocabulary that enables
   publishers to signal preferences for AI training concerning their
   content.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Scope

   The AI-PREF vocabulary is limited to expressing content preferences
   for AI training and does not include enforcement mechanisms or client
   authentication.  Default opt-in or opt-out statuses are beyond the
   scope of this proposal, as it focuses solely on establishing a
   standard for signalling explicit preferences.  In cases where no
   preferences are signalled, the decision on whether this constitutes
   an opt-in or opt-out should be determined at the policy level
   downstream.

   It is important to note that preference signals are advisory.

4.  Vocabulary Elements / Preference Signals

4.1.  Permission

   Basic indicators of whether content can be used for AI training.

   *  *allow_training*: Boolean

   *  *restricted_training:* public, non-commercial, internal, licensed

4.2.  Purpose

   Defines acceptable uses in training.

   *  *purpose*: String:

      -  *generation*: Creating models that are capable of generating
         content

      -  *embedding*: Converting content to vector representations

         o  *classification*: Categorising or labelling content

         o  *summary*: Creating condensed versions of content

         o  *paraphrase*: Creating derivative versions of content

         o  *quotation*: Repetition of a passage or fragment of original
            content

         o  *translation*: Converting content between languages

4.3.  Temporal Restrictions

   Specifies the date range for training use.

   *  *effective_date*: ISO 8601 Date string

   *  *expiration_date*: ISO 8601 Date string

4.4.  Content-Specific Granularity

   Defines the scope of applicability.  Refers to the level at which
   preferences apply within the content.

   *  *scope*: global, content-specific, conditional

4.5.  Content Type

   Specifies content types the preference applies to.

   *  *mime_type*: text, image, video, audio, application, [RFC2046].

4.6.  Derivative Content

   Allows or restricts derivatives like summaries.

   *  *allow_derivatives*: Boolean

   *  *derivative_type*: summary, paraphrase, translation

4.7.  Data Retention

   Defines content retention period post-training.

   *  *retention_period*: ISO 8601 Duration string (e.g.,
      P3Y6M4DT12H30M5S)

4.8.  Preference Persistence

   Indicates if preferences should persist in derived datasets, or be
   optional.  A derived dataset is the result of processing,
   transforming, or extracting information from the original source,
   such as aggregated statistics and summaries, or subsets of data.

   *  *metadata_persistence*: Boolean

4.9.  Precedence

   Conflicts should be resolved by assigning precedence values (e.g.,
   high, medium, low) to rules, with a defined hierarchy that allows
   content producers to override publishers, domain operators, and
   others as necessary.

   *  *precedence:* Sets priority when preferences conflict with other
      layered preferences.

4.10.  Geographic Restrictions

   Specifies regions where preferences apply, ISO 3166-1.

   *  *geo_limitations:* Specifies geographic regions where training
      permissions apply.

5.  Implementation Considerations

   Implementing the AI-PREF vocabulary effectively can be accomplished
   using various mechanisms, depending on the needs and existing
   infrastructure of content publishers.  Approaches include, but are
   not limited to, using HTTP headers, possible extensions to [RFC9309]
   ([PURPOSE]), and (for example) <meta> tags and other embedded data
   (such as EXIF) for sub-document-level control.

5.1.  HTTP Headers

   Publishers can use HTTP headers to communicate AI-PREF preferences
   directly in response to client requests.  This approach allows fine-
   grained control and easy integration into existing server
   configurations.

   *Example header:*

   AI-PREF: allow_training=true; purpose=generation,classification; retention_period=P3Y6M4DT12H30M5S

   This header specifies that the content can be used for text
   generation and classification, with a retention period of 3 years, 6
   months, 4 days, 12 hours, 30 minutes, and 5 seconds.  The syntax and
   options should be carefully chosen to ensure compatibility with
   common web servers and clients.

5.2.  Robots Exclusion Protocol (REP)

   For publishers who already use REP (as defined in RFC9309
   (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9309/)), extending REP rules to
   include AI-PREF preferences could be beneficial.

   Example rule:

   User-agent: *
   Allow-Training: non-commercial
   Purpose: embedding, summarisation

   This REP rule specifies that all user agents are allowed to use the
   content for non-commercial AI training, limited to embedding and
   summarisation purposes.  Further extensions to REP could specify
   additional constraints, such as geographic limitations or temporal
   restrictions.

5.3.  <meta> Tags for Sub-Document Level Control

   To specify AI-PREF preferences at the level of individual HTML
   documents or specific parts of a document, <meta> tags and HTML
   attributes can be used.

   Example <meta> tag:

   <meta name="AI-PREF" content="allow_training=false; retention_period=0">

   Example HTML attribute:

   <div data-aipref="allow_training=false; retention_period=0">

   The methods above specify that AI training is not allowed for the
   content of this document, with no retention period permitted. <meta>
   tags can be used to provide specific content preferences for a
   specific piece of content, and thus provide a flexible way to manage
   AI training signals at a more granular level.

5.4.  “Well-Known” Locations

   According to [RFC8615], “well-known” locations can serve metadata or
   configuration information that is easily discoverable by automated
   clients.  AI-PREF preferences can be published at a “well-known” URL.
   There is already the Text and Data Mining Reservation Protocol
   (TDMRep (https://www.w3.org/community/reports/tdmrep/CG-FINAL-tdmrep-
   20240510/)) which has the same or overlapping intent.

   Example:

   https://example.com/.well-known/aipref

   At this URL, a JSON or other structured format can specify AI-PREF
   preferences for the entire domain or specific content types.

   Example JSON 1:

   {
     "allow_training": false,
     "purpose": ["generation"],
     "retention_period": "0"
   }

   Example JSON 2:

   {
     "version": "1.0",
     "resources": [
       {
         "path": "/videos/tutorial.mp4",
         "type": "video/mp4",
         "components": [
           {
             "name": "Introduction",
             "time-range": "00:00:00-00:01:00",
             "preferences": {
               "classification": "allowed",
               "embedding": "allowed"
             }
           },
           {
             "name": "Main Content",
             "time-range": "00:01:01-00:05:00",
             "preferences": {
               "generation": "prohibited",
               "summarization": "allowed"
             }
           }
         ]
       }
     ]
   }

   This approach simplifies discovery for automated clients and provides
   a centralised way to communicate content preferences across a domain.

   TDMRep Example:

   A rightsholder could expose a “well-known” TDMRep file at:

   https://example.com/.well-known/tdmrep

   Example TDMRep JSON Content:

   {
     "version": "1.0",
     "license": "https://example.com/license",
     "contact": {
       "email": "tdm-support@example.com",
       "url": "https://example.com/contact"
     },
     "resources": [
       {
         "path": "/articles/",
         "type": "text/html",
         "restriction": "no-crawling"
       },
       {
         "path": "/api/data/",
         "type": "application/json",
         "restriction": "license-required"
       }
     ]
   }

5.5.  Embedded Metadata

   Preferences for multimodal data can be embedded directly into file
   metadata (such as EXIF or XMP) as self-contained control signals.
   Compatibility and tamper resistance (e.g. signing) should be
   considered.

   Example EXIF:

   AI-Pref-Allow-Training: false
   AI-Pref-Purpose: embedding
   AI-Pref-Retention-Period: 0

   Example PDF Metadata Using XMP:

   <x:xmpmeta xmlns:x="adobe:ns:meta/">
      <rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#">
         <rdf:Description rdf:about=""
            xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">
            <dc:Rights>Text mining allowed; Data sharing restricted</dc:Rights>
         </rdf:Description>
      </rdf:RDF>
   </x:xmpmeta>

   Preferences can be applied at the file level, or even to specific
   components (e.g., chapters in a PDF or frames in a video).

   Example WEBVTT:

WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Usage Preferences: allow_training=true; purpose=generation,classification

00:01:01.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Usage Preferences: allow_training=false;

5.6.  Content Credentials (ISO 22144)

   TBD

5.7.  ISCC (ISO 24138)

   TBD

6.  Example Usage Scenarios

   TODO examples

7.  Security Considerations

   This document does not affect the security of the Internet.  AI-PREF
   preferences do not include enforcement mechanisms, which should be
   addressed by AI model developers.  Publishers should be aware that
   preferences may not prevent unauthorised use and may rely on mutual
   agreements or legal protections.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require any immediate IANA actions but may
   suggest future registry entries for the vocabulary terms to support
   interoperability.
